# Library Information System, React JS
This is a sample application that lets you view, create and edit books in a libary catalog as well as view, create and edit authors.

It is built using reactjs, webpack, babel, and bootstrap 3. 

To run this locally:

- clone the repo
- npm install
- npm run dev

The final command will create a live reloading server after any source files are changed
